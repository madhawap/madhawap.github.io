           I am a final year PhD student at the Research School of Computer Science of Australian National University, advised by <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/armin-haller" target="_blank">Associate Professor Armin Haller</a>, <a href="https://people.csiro.au/A/M/Matt-Adcock" target="_blank">Dr. Matt Adcock</a> and <a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/tom-gedeon-5e48a1fd/" target="_blank">Professor Tom Gedeon</a>.

           My research sits at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and knowledge modeling. My current research focuses on semantic modelling of human gesture interactions, with relevant user context, in fully immersed environments. I propose to build a technique to facilitate this modelling (of user interactions), aiming to enable intelligent querying of such interactions in immersive environments. Further, I investigate the human interactions in the digital twins of real-world setups. Applications of this setup cater to multiple outcomes such as assisting HCI researchers to conduct effective remote user studies and commercial vendors (such as immersive supermarkets, device manufacturers) to analyse user interactions and to identify personalized interaction of users in different contexts. This can be further expanded to user behaviour analysis based on the type of inputs that AR/VR devices facilitate e.g. readability of physiological signal.

           Broadly, I'm passionate about studying novel human interaction in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (immersive) environments. My specific areas of application have spanned from understanding user interaction and environmental context and semantical modeling of large volume of data ingested by wearable AR/VR devices.

           For my current work I am using Oculus Quest and HoloLens 2. I am experienced with Unity game engine, C# scripting and building AR/VR applications. For data analysis and visualizations I mainly use Python and R.

           When there's time, I like to bake (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/myfoodepisodes/" target="_blank">@myfoodepisodes</a>), play Ukulele (which I started recently), <a href="https://madhawacperera.medium.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>, volunteer, or enjoy a long distance running.
